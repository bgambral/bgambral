#Hi! I'm Brandon and I'm learning my way around coding and everything informatics.

I love the outdoors and playing video games.
I'm a big fan of colder weather.
Android is better than Apple.
Rock music is better than country.
I'll take a Teams meeting over a Zoom call any day. 

Nice to have you visit this space and hope you learned a little about me!
